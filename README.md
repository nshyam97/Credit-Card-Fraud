# Credit Card Fraud Classifier

This is a quick project I did using data from dataworld to classify credit card fraud data.

Due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset, I am using both an undersampled version and an oversampled version to compare the differences if any and will be using SMOTE (tbc) as another option.
